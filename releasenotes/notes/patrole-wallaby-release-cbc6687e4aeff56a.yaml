prelude: |
    This release is to tag the Patrole for OpenStack Wallaby release.
    This release marks the start of Wallaby release support in Patrole.
    After this release, Patrole will support below OpenStack Releases:

    * Wallaby
    * Victoria
    * Ussuri
    * Train

    Current development of Patrole is for OpenStack Xena development
    cycle. Every Patrole commit is also tested against master during
    the Xena cycle. However, this does not necessarily mean that using
    Patrole as of this tag will work against a Xena (or future release)
    cloud.
    To be on safe side, use this tag to test the OpenStack Wallaby release.
