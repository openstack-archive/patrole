prelude: |
    This release is to tag the Patrole for OpenStack Yoga release.
    This release marks the start of Yoga release support in Patrole.
    After this release, Patrole will support below OpenStack Releases:

    * Yoga
    * Xena
    * Wallaby
    * Victoria
    * Ussuri

    Current development of Patrole is for OpenStack Zed development
    cycle. Every Patrole commit is also tested against master during
    the Zed cycle. However, this does not necessarily mean that using
    Patrole as of this tag will work against a Yoga (or future release)
    cloud.
    To be on safe side, use this tag to test the OpenStack Yoga release.
